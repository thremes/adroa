 * This is your child theme functions file.  In general, most PHP customizations should be placed within this

 * documentation and support forums before making a decision.  In most cases, what you want to accomplish
 * can be done from this file alone.  This isn't a foreign practice introduced by parent/child themes.  This is
 * how WordPress works.  By utilizing the functions.php file, you are both future-proofing your site and using
 * a general best practice for coding.
 *
 * All style/design changes should take place within your style.css file, not this one.
 *
 * The functions file can be your best friend or your worst enemy.  Always double-check your code to make
 * sure that you close everything that you open and that it works before uploading it to a live site.
